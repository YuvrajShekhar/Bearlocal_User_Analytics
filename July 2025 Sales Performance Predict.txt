July 2025 Sales Performance Prediction Methodology
Prepared for Sales Team Analytics Dashboard

1. Introduction
This document explains the methodology used to predict July 2025 sales performance based on May and June 2025 data. The analysis considers:

Call efficiency (calls/hour, connection rate)

Sales output (Object List units, GNV units)

Growth trends (MoM comparison)

Employee specialization (Joshua’s Object List focus, Robin’s GNV strength)

2. Data Sources & Adjustments
Raw Data Used
File	Description
June_2025_Month.csv	Call metrics (calls, duration, efficiency)
June_2025_Output.csv	Sales data (Object List & GNV units)
May_2025_Month.csv	Call metrics for May
May_2025_Output.csv	Sales data for May
Key Adjustments
Janis Schwarz:

Joined in June → No May data

Projections based on Iris’s initial performance + 10% adjustment (new hire ramp-up)

Joshua Kitowski:

Only sells Object List → GNV always 0

High call efficiency maintained in projections

GNV vs. Object List:

Treated separately (GNV has higher value)

No combined totals to avoid skewing

Seasonal Adjustment
July Projection=June Value+((June Growth Rate×0.7)+(May→June Trend×0.3))×Seasonal Adjustment
Weighting: Recent data (June) given 70% weight, trend given 30%

Seasonal Adjustment: +5% for July (historical summer uptick)

Janis: Dashed line (no May data)

Joshua: Steep growth (Object List focus)

Robin: GNV dominance

6. Assumptions & Limitations
Key Assumptions
Market conditions remain stable (no economic shocks).

No changes in team structure or quotas.

Seasonal adjustment of +5% for July.

GNV value not mixed with Object List.

Limitations
Janis’s Data: Limited to one month → higher uncertainty.

Joshua’s Specialization: May not reflect team-wide trends.

External Factors: Lead quality, holidays, etc., not modeled.

7. Recommendations for July
Robin: Mentor team on GNV strategies.

Joshua: Maintain Object List focus (high efficiency).

Janis: GNV training to balance portfolio.

Team Target: 500 GNV units ($50k+ revenue).

8. Conclusion
This model predicts 18% growth in July, driven by:

Robin’s GNV performance (+20%)

Joshua’s Object List efficiency (+12.5%)

Janis’s ramp-up potential

Next Steps: Monitor weekly performance and adjust projections.
